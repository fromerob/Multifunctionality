# Multifunctionality
# README

## Overview

This repository contains R code used to reproduce analyses presented in the manuscript titled **"The soil microbiome as an indicator of function across Europe"**.
## Content

### Statistical Analyses
The repository includes scripts for all statistical analyses presented in the manuscript, including:

1. **Multifunctionality calculation**: The code imports the data and performs z-score transformation, then aggregates relevant variables (functions) to calculate multifunctionality
2. **Random Forest Models**: Used to assess the importance of different predictors on multifunctionality.
3. **Structural Equation Models (SEM)**: Applied to understand the direct and indirect relationships between climate, environmental variables, and multifunctionality. The code to produce SEMs has been written by Dr. Dongxue Xao [taodx879@nenu.edu.cn].
